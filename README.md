# Fraud-Detection-using-ML
🔍 Project Overview
This machine learning project focuses on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using historical data. By analyzing patterns in previous transactions, the system predicts whether a new transaction is likely to be fraudulent. The solution employs advanced machine learning techniques to identify suspicious activity with high accuracy.

📊 Key Features
Data Processing: Cleansing and transformation of transactional data

Exploratory Analysis: Identification of fraud patterns across multiple dimensions

Model Comparison: Evaluation of multiple ML algorithms

Optimized Solution: XGBoost implementation for high-precision fraud detection

Deployment Ready: Serialized model for integration into production systems

🧾 Dataset
Source: Historical transaction records

Size: 1,000 records with 19 features

Features: Transaction details including location, device information, payment method, and more

Target Variable: Binary fraud indicator (fraud/not fraud)

🛠️ Technical Implementation
Data Preprocessing
python
# Clean dataset
df = df.dropna()  # Remove null values
df = df.drop_duplicates()  # Remove duplicates
df = df.drop(['unnecessary_column1', 'unnecessary_column2'], axis=1)  # Feature selection
🔬 Exploratory Data Analysis
Conducted comprehensive analysis to identify fraud patterns:

City vs. Fraud occurrence

Payment method vs. Fraud likelihood

Device type vs. Fraud patterns

Transaction amount distributions

Time-based fraud trends

🤖 Model Selection
Evaluated three machine learning algorithms:

Random Forest Classifier

XGBoost Classifier

Decision Tree Classifier

Performance Comparison:

Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	AUC
XGBoost	0.97	0.95	0.93	0.98
Random Forest	0.94	0.91	0.89	0.95
Decision Tree	0.90	0.87	0.84	0.91
🏆 Final Model
XGBoost was selected as the optimal solution due to superior performance across all evaluation metrics. The finalized model was serialized using Python's pickle module for deployment.

python
import pickle

# Save the trained model
with open('fraud_detection_model.pkl', 'wb') as file:
    pickle.dump(xgb_model, file)
⚙️ Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fraud-detection-ml.git
cd fraud-detection-ml
Create a virtual environment:

bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/MacOS
venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
🚀 Usage
Load the pre-trained model:

python
import pickle

with open('fraud_detection_model.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    model = pickle.load(file)
Preprocess new transaction data (ensure same format as training data)

Make predictions:

python
predictions = model.predict(new_transaction_data)
fraud_probabilities = model.predict_proba(new_transaction_data)[:, 1]
